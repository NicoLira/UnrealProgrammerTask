The System consist in a Skateboarding Simulator Game inspired on Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3. The BP_SkaterController (PlayerController) process the inputs and set different variables in the BP_Skater (Character) [such as Pushing, PreparingJump] and his MovementComponent [such as Velocity and jump functions]. The ABP_Skater is in charge of animating the player depending it's state, it has it's own logic for that. The simple score system is just a triggerbox that auments the score in the BP_Skater.

I would evaluate my performance as an 8/10 given the context, I think is a good outcome, it's not to hard to extend, and using the controllers should be compatible with multiplayer usage (not tested in this case).
